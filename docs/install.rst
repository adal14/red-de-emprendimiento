=========

In order to get this project running, install the `requirements.txt` with the
following command.

``pip install -r requirements.txt``

Also we recommend to install two very interesting gems. Travis and travis-lint
in the following way.

``$ gem install travis``
``$ gem install travis-lint``

In Mac OS X  Mavericks normally requires the inclusion of of ``sudo`` before any
commands.
